		    <h1>Profil</h1>
			<p align="justify"> <br> My proposed activities as freelancer will benefit from my accumulated experiences in related fields of big data management and analysis; innovative phenotyping of rare, complex, and difficult-to-measure traits; and statistical and quantitative genetic modeling as applied to animal breeding. My research career is also particular as I achieved both industry and scientific exposure giving me a better understanding how basic research can ultimately lead to a precise impact in the field of animal production1. I also moved from more applied to basic research.. </p>
            <h2>As ingeneer on applied R&D</h2>
            <p align="justify">I was graduated in 1987 as an agricultural engineer in animal and fodder productions. I started my professional career in the field of research and development by characterizing the small ruminant farming systems under traditional and extensive conditions in northern and montains regions of Tunisia (OEP-GTZ). Then, my professional experiences was accumulated in R&D within the national organization for the development of livestock and its national center for genetic improvement in the field of animal resources management, genetic and health traceability (CAG-OEP ).</p>
            <h2>As a scientific researcher</h2>
            <p>After this professional experience in R&D in the livestock industry, I decided to complete my training course first with a MSc in genetics and animal reproduction (INAT, Tunisia), then another MSc in agricultural sciences and biological engineering (FUSAGx, Belgium). I applied for and obtained a competitive PhD grant from the National Funds for Scientific Research (FNR) of Luxembourg for a doctoral research period of 4 yrs to investigate genotype by environment interaction of Holstein dairy cows as a proxy-indicator of their adaptive capacity using two Holstein populations. In the next step of my career I applied and was funded as a Postodoctoral fellow (Chargé de recherches) for a research period of 4 yrs by the FNRS, extending my research activities on genetic diversity and adaptation into the context of climate change. The achievements in the field of heat stress studies were attracting for several other research groups and enhanced an active collaboration with an international research networks.</p>
           <p> <br>In fine, I had an active collaboration as a researcher with the genetics, genomics and numerical modeling (ULiège-GxABT, Belgium). I gained a degree of maturity and an expertise in life sciences and the modeling of production processes wihin the group on the field of BigData management and analysis; innovative phenotyping of rare, complex and difficult to measure traits; and statistical, genetic and genomic modeling applied to animal breeding and herd management and various environments.</p>
           <p> <br>I was also very active in the training and supervision of future engineers, field advisers, supervisors and young researchers in the field of animal production sciences, the digitilisation of data collection and acquisition, and on data modeling and the valuation of research results.</p>
           <p> <br>I have carried out various consulting and support missions for breeders, professional organizations on aspects concerning the sustainability of breeding systems under changing socio-economic and environmental environments.</p>
